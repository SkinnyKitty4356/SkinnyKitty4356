- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SkinnyKitty4356, you can just call me Kitty, or S K
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in way too many things for one single text line
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Systems Programming
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ... projects for school? Maybe some spotify playlists?
- ðŸ“« How to reach me; SkinnyKitty4356@hotmail.com
- Pronouns: She/her, they/them
- I spend a lot of my free time crafting
- I have a seven year old rescue cat, who came to me as a kitten in the parking lot
- I prefer sitting on the floor, rather than in chairs. Yes, I am neuro-spicy.
- I think I'm most excited about going to A.S. because of my friend, who is about to graduate, and how highly he spoke of the program he took
- I'm vegan, and have been for several years
- I have mild facial aphasia, which means some faces just blend into the crowd for me. I have to focus on you, to find something that stands out (or associate you with someone famous) to make you recognizeable on sight alone.
- I DO recognize most voices right away.
- I'm excited to meet all of you.. at our own paces, of course.
